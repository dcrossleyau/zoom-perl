=head1 NAME

ZOOM - Perl extension implementing the ZOOM API for Information Retrieval

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use ZOOM;
 eval {
     $conn = new ZOOM::Connection($host, $port)
     $conn->option(preferredRecordSyntax => "usmarc");
     $rs = $conn->search_pqf($query);
     $n = $rs->size();
     print $rs->record(0)->render();
 };
 if ($@) {
     print "Error ", $@->code(), ": ", $@->message(), "\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a nice, Perlish implementation of the ZOOM
Abstract API described at http://zoom.z3950.org/api/

the ZOOM module is implemented as a set of thin classes on top of the
non-OO functions provided by the Net::Z3950::ZOOM module, which in
turn is a thin layer on top of the ZOOM-C code supplied as part of
Index Data's YAZ Toolkit.  Because ZOOM-C is also the underlying code
that implements ZOOM bindings in C++, Visual Basic, Scheme, Ruby, .NET
(including C#) and other languages, this Perl module works compatibly
with those other implementations.  (Of course, the point of a public
API such as ZOOM is that all implementations should be compatible
anyway; but knowing that the same code is running is reassuring.)

I<###> There is rather more to say here :-)
