This directory contains Red Hat packages for Perl modules that we need
but which are not included in the standard operating-system
distribution.  At present, this includes:
	XML::LibXML::XPathContext
	Marc::Record

The source tarballs were downloaded from:
http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/P/PA/PAJAS/XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07.tar.gz
http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GM/GMCHARLT/MARC-Record-2.0.2.tar.gz

I made the corresponding .spec files by hand.

$ sudo rpm -i *.rpm
