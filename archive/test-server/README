These files are used to run the server that the ZOOM-Perl test-suite's
"packages" scripts run against.

README -- this file
update-client -- notes on using update facilities in YAZ.
test-server.notes -- notes on running the test server.
test-server.init -- script to run the test server from /etc/init.d
test-server.cfg -- Zebra configuration file for the test server.
test-server.pw -- password file for test server's Zebra configuration.

Over time, the Zebra database where the ZOOM-Perl package read-write
tests take place becomes bloated and unclean: when I checked on 15
October 2010, there were over 15000 "sort<NUMBER>-0.mf" files!  As a
result, the test-suite becomes slower, to the point where
26-packages.t takes two and half minutes to run.

When this happens, reset the database to a clean state:

$ ssh mike@z3950.indexdata.com
$ cd ZOOM-Perl/archive/test-server
$ sudo /etc/init.d/zoom-perl-server stop
$ sudo zebraidx-2.0 -c test-server.cfg init
$ sudo zebraidx-2.0 -c test-server.cfg update ../../../idzebra/examples/gils/records
	(This may take a few minutes!)
$ # If desired, test with: zebrasrv-2.0 -c test-server.cfg
$ sudo /etc/init.d/zoom-perl-server start
$ exit

Once this has been done, the time to run 26-packages.t should drop
back down to four or five seconds!
