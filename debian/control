Description:  Perl extension implementing the ZOOM API for Information Retrieval
 This module provides a nice, Perlish implementation of the ZOOM
 Abstract API described and documented at http://zoom.z3950.org/api/
 .
 the ZOOM module is implemented as a set of thin classes on top of the
 non-OO functions provided by this distribution's Net::Z3950::ZOOM
 module, which in 
 turn is a thin layer on top of the ZOOM-C code supplied as part of
 Index Data's YAZ Toolkit.  Because ZOOM-C is also the underlying code
 that implements ZOOM bindings in C++, Visual Basic, Scheme, Ruby, .NET
 (including C#) and other languages, this Perl module works compatibly
 with those other implementations.  (Of course, the point of a public
 API such as ZOOM is that all implementations should be compatible
 anyway; but knowing that the same code is running is reassuring.)
